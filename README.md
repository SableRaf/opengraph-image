# Repo OpenGraph Image Generator

By default, GitHub creates an OpenGraph image for your repository. You can also customize this by providing a custom image. However, a static image will not include the same information as the default image (such as stars, watchers, and fork count).

This tool generates an OG image that displays the repository details and stats. The method is inspired by [this post](https://github.blog/open-source/git/framework-building-open-graph-images/) on the GitHub blog.

## Usage

1. Create a new repository in your GitHub
